  Enhancing the suitability of Sentinel-1 SAR data for the analysis of soil moisture via Google Earth Engine

Abstract:

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an important remote sensing technique used for estimating soil moisture. Sentinel-1 SAR data have been widely used for soil moisture analysis as they are openly accessible and provide high spatial and temporal resolutions at a global scale. Researchers and academics are increasingly using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform as it offers Sentinel-1 Analysis-Ready-Data (ARD), which processing is performed efficiently on its cloud-based servers. This study developed an optimised Sentinel-1 GEE processing workflow to extract SAR-derived soil moisture. The optimised workflow was obtained after extracting, evaluating, and finally validating a series of speckle noise and terrain corrected SAR backscatter (σ0) products with in-situ COSMOS-UK Volumetric Water Count (VWC) data. The results have shown that the optimised workflow significantly reduces the effects of SAR terrain-induced distortions caused by the study site’s tilted terrain and permanent vegetation cover. The JavaScript and Python codes developed in this study are publicly accessible and can be used to extract and evaluate SAR-derived soil moisture at any site.
